Consider the alternative basis $b_2 = (1, x, x^2-1)$. These are the first three Legendre Polynomials. They have nice properties and are used often in applied math. Write $M(T, b_2)$.

\problem{2} For the following propositions, decide if they are true or false, and cite a theorem you would use to prove so. If the proposition is nonsensical, explain why it is so.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\dim \RR^2 = \dim \CC^2$ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
	\item On the space of Polynomials: $\PP(\RR)$, let $I$ be the mapping $$I(\vec{p}(x)) = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} (x^2-1)\vec{p}(x) dx\text{.}$$ Then $I(x^2-1)$ is a subspace of $\PP(\RR)$. \\ \\ \\ \\
	\item $ \dim \CC^2 = 4$ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
	%\item $\{(1,0), (0,1), (i,0), (0,i) \}$ is a basis for $\CC^2$ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
	\item Consider the vector space $V = \CC^2$ over the field $\RR$. Here vectors look like $(z_1, z_2)$ where $z_1$ and $z_2$ are complex numbers and scalars are real numbers. Then %$\dim V = 4$. \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\

Consider the element of the quotient space $(3,3) + U \in V/U$. Plot the subspace $U$, the element of the quotient space $(3,3) + U$ and the vector $(3,3) \in \RR^2$ in the same plane below. Be sure to label everything clearly for full credit.
