\hspace{-.5 ex}\problem{1} Consider the space $\PP_2(\RR)$ and the function $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : \PP_2(\RR) \times \PP_2(\RR) \to \RR$ given by
\begin{align}
\langle p, q \rangle = \int_{-1}^{1} p(x) q(x) x^2 dx\label{inner1}

For $p,q,r \in \PP_2(\RR)$ and $\lambda \in \RR$ prove the following:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item \textbf{additivity in the first slot}: $\langle p+q, r \rangle = \langle p,r\rangle + \langle q,r\rangle$ \\

	\item \textbf{positive definite}: $\langle p, p \rangle \geq 0$ and $\langle p, p \rangle=0 \iff p=0$. \\(Note that $(1, x, x^2)$ form a basis.) \textit{This might be Analysis heavy. Perhaps it should be extra credit.}\\

\problem{7} Suppose we wish to approximate the function $f(x) = \sin(x)$ over the interval $[-2\pi,2\pi]$ with a polynomial. We will consider 3 polynomials as good candidates: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $T_9(x)$ - the 9th degree Taylor Series.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		%\caption{Equispaced points}
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{taylor}
		\centering
	\end{figure}
	\item $P_9(x)$ - the polynomial that interpolates at 9 equally spaced points.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		%\caption{Equispaced points}
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{equispaced}
		\centering
	\end{figure}
	\item $Q_9(x)$ - the polynomial that interpolates at 9 Chebyshev points.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		%\caption{Equispaced points}
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{chebyshev}
		\centering
	\end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

If we wish to compare these approximations, we must define a norm on continuous real-valued functions in order to say which is a ``closer" approximation. Specifically, if we have two polynomials $p(x), q(x)$, and a norm $\norm{\cdot}$,  we say that $p$ is a better approximation than $q$ under the given norm, if $\norm{p - f} < \norm{q - f}$. We consider the following inner products on continuous functions, and their induced norms:
\begin{align*}
	\langle f, g \rangle_2 & = \int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi} f(x)g(x) dx & \norm{f}_2 &= \sqrt{\int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi} \vert f(x) \vert^2 dx} & \tag{Euclidian Norm} \\
	 &  \text{(N/A)} & \norm{f}_\infty &= \max_{x \in [-2\pi, 2\pi]}\{f(x)\} & \tag{Max Norm} \\
	\langle f, g \rangle_* & = \int_{\pi}^{\pi} f(x)g(x) dx & \norm{f}_* &= \sqrt{\int_{-\frac{3}{2}\pi}^{\frac{3}{2}\pi} \vert f(x) \vert^2 dx} & \tag{Interior Norm} \\
\end{align*}
The $\norm{\cdot}_2$ norm can be though of as a least squares goodness of fit, giving larger error more weight than smaller error over over the same length. The $\norm{\cdot}_\infty$ can be thought of as measuring the maximum error. Note that there is no inner-product that will induce this norm, but it is a valid norm on continuous functions over closed intervals. Lastly $\norm{\cdot}_*$ is not concerned with error near the boundary. The approximating polynomials and their errors are shown in the same plot below for ease of comparison.

Which of the following seems true? Justify your answers.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item $\norm{T_9-f}_2 < \norm{P_9-f}_2 < \norm{Q_9-f}_2$ (Equispaced interpolation is better.)
	\item $\norm{T_9-f}_2 < \norm{Q_9-f}_2 < \norm{P_9-f}_2$ (Chebyshev interpolation is better.)\\\\\\\\
	
	\item $\norm{T_9-f}_\infty < \norm{P_9-f}_\infty < \norm{Q_9-f}_\infty$ 
	\item $\norm{T_9-f}_\infty < \norm{Q_9-f}_\infty < \norm{P_9-f}_\infty$ \\\\\\\\
	
	\item $\norm{T_9-f}_* < \norm{P_9-f}_* < \norm{Q_9-f}_*$
